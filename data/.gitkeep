# Data Directory

This directory is used to store local SQLite database files when running in local mode.

The SQLite database file `local.db` will be automatically created here when you run:

```bash
npm run start:local
```

## Files

- `local.db` - Main SQLite database file (auto-generated)
- `local.db-journal` - Journal file for database transactions
- `local.db-shm` - Shared memory file
- `local.db-wal` - Write-ahead log file

All these files are git-ignored and will be created automatically.

## Clean Data

To reset the local database, simply delete this directory:

```bash
rm -rf ./data
```

It will be recreated on next startup.
